As if that point - of - fact isn't painfully obvious, right? 

**The GOALS** : 
1. Build Bridges,
2. Close Gaps,
3. Bend Curves,
4. Blur Color (or altogether change theory),
5. Light the freaking world on fire as we know it changing the game for generations to come. 

True Meritocracy with an altruist approach to the SERP game that is. The authors are philosophers. But they're getting - either cocky - or off - center. WOuldn't you agree? 

--- 

If you are sick and tired of the *unconscious bias*, *learned trait hate*, and altogether awful hiring practices + *US* way-of-being set - forth from #TopsTimesUp i.e: the corporate liars, thieves, and PR pushing philandering - by all means - feel free to join in. Help change the game for our grandkids grandkids here. As it stands our grandchildrens grandchildren won't 'have an earth to thrive on with the punishment we've done to it. Has anyone taken a deep dive into the *agricultural crisis* that is? As it stands, statistically we are not sustainable in 20 years time folks. That's simply *unacceptable*. 

No Rules. JUST RIGHT.
> As the great characters of the Pixar Animated Studios (copyrightÂ­ 2020 - or something like that & all rights reserved - with no affiliations) say, just do the [freaking] *next right thing*.

Or we can go **Jim Caviezel** (not even getting Messianic - yet) with **Elijah Wood** best film ever - and go with a **Pay it Forward** guideline. 

The point is **True North**. 

Talking wholly authentic. 

With no ulterior motive. 

Or preservation slash self - interest to muddy the project. 

If you're still reading this - you're not only the community I seek - you're about 1 in 100,000 - so know - **your contribution is both valuable** and **appreciated**. 

## TRUE NORTH Y'all.

> That is the singular ask. 

If followed, it will remain that way. With a community - tribal approach to the whole - gamut. 

The big stuff is coming. With powerful - powerful players. 

I'm not here to self - promote. 

I'm here to point out I've spent eight years grossly mistreated. 

I've lost well over a million in earnable income I will never get to recapture. 

I am no different nor no more guilty than yourself. But, I commited - what **US** calls a crime. I did my time. While still doing it daily. However, owned my guilt years ago. A non - violent, non - sales - simple possession case. 

I fought my dependence to the *American Prescribing Practices*. While eight years into this Violation of a Controlled Substance Abuse Act  (Class II & IV). From meds I held prescriptions to. And only - I mean only and immediately after a car accident and career - ending back-injury. 

I live in a most awful state of stuck. 

Literally not sustainable. 

While being recognized for *best practices in sustainability*. Plus asked as high and far as the **United Nations to apply** for their **International Best Practices in Sustainable Development**. 

Applying to that would have gone against my singular rule. Therefore, I did not. Then as recent as the week of 15 June, 2020 and the most recent of the dozens these past years, was turned down by **Public Storage**. For a non-managerial remote customer-service role. 

That's the hypocrisy. It's so glaringly clear to someone whose walked three steps in the broken flip-flops I wear. 

And yet, completely elusive to the one's (fortunate enough) who've never found themselves walking that walk. 

Does that make sense? 

I hope this reaches one actionable, living, breathing human or machine (because I whisper to algorithms with the best of 'em - just run that SERP on me). 

And choose to go : 

- Site -less.
- Code -less. 
- Audience -less. 

Effect : Community -less. 

Thank stigma. Plus stubborn.

**Help me change this.** *Please?*
