> Be nimble about Lean Six Sigma ‚Äì to get started, just remember the DMAIC high-level approach and create a document with the five steps outlined. For each step, think of the following points:    

**D**: | Define: | What's the objective? Can you state it as a SMART one? Who will be involved or impacted? What is in or out of scope?
:---|:---:|:---
**M**: | Measure: | What are the data sources? Anything missing? Is it good quality data? Can you gain initial insight from this data without too much effort?
**A**: | Analyze: | What are the correlations and patterns? This is where your analysis skills are truly put to work!
**I**: | Improve: | Be creative, think about various solutions that balance the optimal/best solution vs. what is realistic given the constraints.
**C**: | Control: | It's not over until you can report the impact of your work ‚Äìbe humble and remember improvement rarely come from a sudden 100% increase in something, but from small improvements to dozens of little things.
