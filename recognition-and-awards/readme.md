# Chasing the Wind Year in Review 

---

It was an event filled (1 week prior to the one year anniversay of a) year; involving names like **SXSW 2020**, half dozen accelerators showing interest, **United Nations *UN-Habitat***, **Inc 5000**, **Red Herring Top 100 Shortlist**, **GovCity III** invite (2nd time SXSW came calling), **Climate Collaborative recognition for sustainability 2020** and then there was Google. And the Google Cloud Executive Support team *Transform.withGoogle offer as a 'select - hand-picked few*. An offer I'd fail huger than huge at. Prior to even getting a chance to speak with Google. 

It's a long story - but... I was 4 and half hours late to the meet - and upon realizing this, while having spend the previous 72 hours pontificating on all things *Google*, with pandemic states of uncertainty having literally just hit center-mass -  my 'official' correspondence letter was sent. 

> Circling back inside the Google Drive was something I shouldn't have done.

The date was less than a week out of whole - earth quarantine, (26 March, 2020). 

The machines were learning; machines learning real - time with flickering screens and *tensor* keys (I swear - the keys get *tensor* still to - this - date. 

Unconscious bias would also slap me in the face from a most unexpected place. And this created the culmination of events that would lead to what I have come to call the *flip scripts : move consciousness* theory. 

I did a full - on witwicky pivot. Right out of what was already - a - fail - huge - continous - immprovement approach (4 and half hours late - thanks in no small part to piece of crap laptop states and the google cloud scheduling screen faux pas). 

It was my very own digital transform-er-nation come to fruition. <br>
