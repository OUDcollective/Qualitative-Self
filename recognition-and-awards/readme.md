# Chasing the Wind Year in Review 

---

It was an event filled (1 week prior to the one year anniversay of a) year; involving names like SXSW 2020, half dozen accelerators showing interest, United Nations, Inc 5000, Red Herring Top 100 Shortlist, GovCity invite (2nd time SXSW came calling), and then there was Google. And the Google Cloud Executive Support team (Transform.withGoogle offer). An offer I'd fail huger than huge at. Prior to even getting a chance to speak with Google. 

It's a long story - but... I was 4 and half hours late to the meet - and upon realizing this,sending my 'official' correspondence letter and circling back inside the Google Drive; well let's just say - the date was less than a week out of whole - earth quarantine, the machines were learning real-time, and unconscious bias would hit me square in the jaw. Causing a witwicky pivot out of what was already a fail-huge - continous immprovement approvement. It was the digital transform-er-nation come to fruition.
